# gjk_with_web
Web interface with 2 draggable and resizable rectangles. GJK algorithm on the backend checks collision and paint rectangles reg if collision.

This project features an interactive web interface that showcases two draggable and resizable rectangles. The backend of the system employs the GJK (Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi) algorithm to detect collisions between the rectangles. Upon collision detection, the rectangles are dynamically repainted to emphasize the collision occurrence.

The web interface provides a hands-on experience where users can manipulate the rectangles' positions and sizes by dragging and resizing them using intuitive interactions. Behind the scenes, the GJK algorithm works diligently to analyze the geometry of the rectangles and identify any intersections, ensuring accurate collision detection.

The beauty of this project lies in its blend of frontend interactivity and backend collision analysis. Feel free to explore the web interface and witness the rectangles' behavior change as they encounter collisions.
